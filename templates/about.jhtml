    I am a junior at Brown University and plan to receive a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics in 2019. I am interested in using math to research topics in aerodynamics, geology, and climate science.

    Me and two friends friends are currently working to start Brown's first experimental rocketry club, working with Brown's chapter of the <a href='http://seds.org/'>SEDS</a>. Over the 2017 summer, we developed a strong and consistent solidÂ fuel mixture and motor geometry, and have simultaenously developed a custom flight computer. The goal is to stabilize the rocket's attitude and automatically deploy a parachute for recoverable flights. We are currently applying for funding to make motors and nozzles out of steel using the CNC Lathe in the Brown Design Workshop.

    During the 2017 summer, I worked in the Fox-Kemper Physical Oceanography lab, developing a backward Euler solver for arbitrary systems of stochastic differential equations. I also helped prepare for the 2017 <a href='https://boltatbrown.wordpress.com'>Brown Outdoor Leadership Training</a> fall backpacking trip, organizing, purchasing, and dividing the food for 180 sophomore, transfers, and RUE students to go on a week-long backpacking trip in late August. I also led a trip with 8 sophomores and transfer students!

    I also enjoy web development, and have worked extensively with Google Apps Script. You can see my projects in the Projects tab on the left.
