                <p class='no-bottom-margin'>
                    I am a junior at Brown University and plan to receive a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics in 2019. I am interested in using math to research topics in aerodynamics, geology, and climate science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Me and two friends friends are currently working to start Brown's first experimental rocketry club, working with Brown's chapter of the <a href='http://seds.org/'>SEDS</a>. Over the 2017 summer, we developed a strong and consistent solidÂ fuel mixture and motor geometry, and have simultaenously developed a custom flight computer. The goal is to stabilize the rocket's attitude and automatically deploy a parachute for recoverable flights. We are currently applying for funding to make motors and nozzles out of steel using the CNC Lathe in the Brown Design Workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 2017 summer, I worked in the Fox-Kemper Physical Oceanography lab, developing a backward Euler solver for arbitrary systems of stochastic differential equations. I also helped prepare for the 2017 <a href='https://boltatbrown.wordpress.com'>Brown Outdoor Leadership Training</a> fall backpacking trip, organizing, purchasing, and dividing the food for 180 sophomore, transfers, and RUE students to go on a week-long backpacking trip in late August. I also led a trip with 8 sophomores and transfer students!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy web development, and have worked extensively with Google Apps Script. You can see my projects in the Projects tab on the left.

                This is a list of code projects I have worked on.
                <ul id='code-projects'>
                    <li><a href='https://github.com/IzzyBrand/explosive-bakery'>github.com/IzzyBrand/explosive-bakery</a> - In progress. This is the code base for the rocketry club me and two friends, Izzy Brand and Ben Shanahan, are working to start. This includes code for a customized thrust testing stand, a flight computer with parachute deployment, and the beginnings of a model for pressure within the motor. In the Fall 2017 semester, we will be working on a PID controller for rocket stabilization attempting to gimbal fins.</li>
                    <li><a href='https://github.com/hveto/hveto'>github.com/hveto/hveto</a> - HVeto, or 'Hierarchical Veto', is a method used at LIGO to rate how significantly correlated noise in channels devoted to external sourses (for instance quantum or seismic) is to noise in the main gravitational wave detector. Signals can be filtered out using this measure of correlation. I helped to implement and improve this method.</li>
                    <li><a href='https://github.com/berkowitze/pysde'>github.com/berkowitze/pysde</a> - Implemented a backward Euler solver for systems of nonlinear equations.
                </ul>
                Below is a list of websites I have worked on.

                Below are several mockups of web apps I built for Oakwood Friend School.
                <ul id='oakwood-projects'>
                    <li>
                        <ul>Student Events - These two apps provide a way for students to sign up for events happening throughout the year. 
                            Faculty can create and manage events, adding trip costs and managing who has paid, sending group emails, etc.

                        <ul>Faculty Reimbursemenrt Request App - Allows faculty to submit a reimbursement request. They submit a picture of the receipt; from there, 
                            the faculty and division chairs confirm the reimbursement. After the two confirmations, the request is sent to the finance department.
